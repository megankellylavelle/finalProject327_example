		Alex nudged both of you to signal y'all that they will be heading over to the bar to order some drinks...
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		After the three of y'all finished a tray of shots together, you went to get a drink for yourself before heading back to your table. On your way back to your friends, a stranger by the bar offers you a drink. Simultaneously, you feel buzzing coming from your phone, do you accept the offer or check your phone?
